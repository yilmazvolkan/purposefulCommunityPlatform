# Purposeful Community Platform
## Introduction
People use various online platforms for reaching out more people. In these platforms, there is so much generality and the purpose is not clear exactly. Also, members suffer from lack of track for certain information. A member may not be aware of in which type to share her/his information and what type of posts are published before.

## Aim of the project
In this project, we aim to create an application that assists people who want to create a community within the scope of a purpose. A community is based on certain structures by letting users create their own types. With these community specific data types, a user can be able to share her/his information in well structured format and easy to comprehend from other users

## Keywords
**Structured Data**: structured data is comprised of clearly defined data types whose pattern makes them easily searchable.

**Purposeful Community**: A community is built on a specific purpose so that people can only sharerelated information in structured format.

**Community Specific Data Types** : Structures created by builders to be used by the community when they want to post related information.
